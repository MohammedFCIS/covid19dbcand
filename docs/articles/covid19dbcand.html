<p><strong>covid19dbcand</strong> is a data package containing different tibbles that constitute the dataset parsed from <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca">DrugBank</a>. The dataset was extracted from the DrugBank XML database via <a href="https://dainanahan.github.io/dbparser/">dbparser</a> R package.</p>
<p>The dataset can be used for conveniently exploring and analyzing the contents of the DrugBank database. The dataset is also intended to assist in drug discovery endeavors that plan to make use of the <strong>DrugBank</strong> database.</p>
<p>Moreover; it also can be used to in Machine Learning in many sub-fields such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
<li>Web Scrapping</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
</ul>
<div id="installation" class="section level3">
<h3 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#installation" class="anchor"></a>Installation</h3>
<p>As the package size exceeds the limit set by CRAN, it will be hosted on Github only for now. Hence, it could be installed via the following command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="kw pkg">devtools</span><span class="kw ns">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org//reference/remote-reexports.html">install_github</a></span>(<span class="st">"Dainanahan/covid19dbcand"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>The datasets will then be available after running the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">covid19dbcand</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Then the pakages will be available to be used as regular <em>R</em> object</p>

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 [A174175].\r\n\r\nIt is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin [A174169].\r\n\r\nAzithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the _azalide_ subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides [A174175].\r\n\r\nIn March 2020, a small study was funded by the French government to investigate the treatment of COVID-19 with a combination of azithromycin and the anti-malaria drug [hydroxychloroquine]. The results were positive, all patients taking the combination were virologically cured within 6 days of treatment, however, larger studies are required.[A192546]</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 3 Ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that interferes with the reproductive cycle of HIV. Although it was initially developed as an independent antiviral agent, it has been shown to possess advantageous properties in combination regimens with low-dose ritonavir and other protease inhibitors. It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulation and as capsules. \r\n\r\nWhile ritonavir is not an active antiviral agent against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it is added in combination therapies indicated for treatment of HCV infections as a booster. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as [DB09297] and overall drug exposure. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend ritonavir-boosted combination therapies as a first-line therapy for HCV Genotype 1a/b and 4 treatment-na\032ve patients with or without cirrhosis. \r\n\r\nRitonavir is found in a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nRitonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296] and [DB09297] as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with Ribavirin for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with [DB09296], [DB09183], and [DB09297] as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis. Inclusion of ritonavir can can select for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions. Any HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with ritonavir-containing combination therapies should also be on a suppressive antiretroviral drug regimen to reduce the risk of HIV-1 protease inhibitor drug resistance.</span>

It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]\r\n\r\nOn the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]</span>

Protease inhibitors block the part of HIV called protease. HIV-1 protease is an enzyme required for the proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein precursors into the individual functional proteins found in infectious HIV-1. Ritonavir binds to the protease active site and inhibits the activity of the enzyme. This inhibition prevents cleavage of the viral polyproteins resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles. Protease inhibitors are almost always used in combination with at least two other anti-HIV drugs.

<span class="co">#&gt; 6 Ibuprofen has multiple actions in different inflammatory pathways involved in acute and chronic inflammation. The main effects reported in ibuprofen are related to the control of pain, fever and acute inflammation by the inhibition of the synthesis of prostanoids by COX-1 and COX-2. Pain relief is attributed to peripheral affected regions and central nervous system effects in the pain transmission mediated by the dorsal horn and higher spinothalamic tract. Some reports have tried to link the pain regulation with a possible enhancement on the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids and action on the NMDA receptors. The effect on pain has been shown to be related to the cortically evoked potentials.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe antipyretic effect is reported to be linked to the effect on the prostanoid synthesis due to the fact that the prostanoids are the main signaling mediator of pyresis in the hypothalamic-preoptic region.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe use of ibuprofen in dental procedures is attributed to the local inhibition of prostanoid production as well as to anti-oedemic activity and an increase of plasma beta-endorphins. Some reports have suggested a rapid local reduction of the expression of COX-2 in dental pulp derived by the administration of ibuprofen.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe administration of ibuprofen in patients with rheumatic diseases has shown to control joint symptoms.[A39092] \r\n\r\nIbuprofen is largely used in OTC products such as an agent for the management of dysmenorrhea which has been proven to reduce the amount of menstrual prostanoids and to produce a reduction in the uterine hypercontractility.[A39181] As well, it has been reported to reduce significantly the fever and the pain caused by migraines.[A39182, A39183] This effect is thought to be related to the effect on platelet activation and thromboxane A2 production which produces local vascular effects in the affected regions. This effect is viable as ibuprofen can enter in the central nervous system.[A39190]\r\n\r\nIn the investigational uses of ibuprofen, it has been reported to reduce neurodegeneration when given in low doses over a long time.[A39184] On the other hand, its use in Parkinson disease is related to the importance of inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathology of this condition.[A39185] The use of ibuprofen for breast cancer is related to a study that shows a decrease of 50% in the rate of breast cancer.[A39186]</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 1 Transcription of the VEGF protein is induced by 'hypoxia inducible factor' (HIF) in a hypoxic environment.[A192939] Various downstream effects occur when VEGF binds to VEGF receptors (VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2) which are located on endothelial cells.[A192834,A192939] VEGF also binds to the neuropilin co-receptors (NRP-1 and NRP-1), which enhances signaling.[A192939,A192951] Cancer cells promote tumor angiogenesis by releasing VEGF, resulting in the creation of an immature and disorganized vascular network.[A192894,A192897] The hypoxic microenvironment created by these cancer cells favors the survival of more aggressive tumor cells, and gives rise to a challenging environment for immune cells to respond appropriately.[A192897,A192900,A192903] As a result, the angiogenic factor has become a well-known target for anti-cancer drugs like bevacizumab.[A192837] Bevacizumab is a mAb that exerts its effects by binding and inactivating serum VEGF.[A192939] When bound to the mAb, VEGF is prevented from interacting with its cell surface receptors, and proangiogenic signalling is inhibited.[A192939] This prevents formation of new blood vessels, decreases tumor vasculature, and reduces tumor blood supply.[A192939,L12648] \r\n\r\nThere is also evidence to suggest that VEGF is upregulated in COVID-19 patients, hence, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of associated complications.[L12699] Higher levels of VEGF may contribute to pulmonary edema, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).[L12699] Researchers are hopeful that by inhibiting VEGF, bevacizumab may effectively treat ARDS and ALI - both common features of severe COVID-19.[L12699]</span>

Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit [FDA label], [A14179].

The *pol*-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, *gag-pol*, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins [A19647]. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the *gag-pol* polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver [A19647]. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase [A19648]. Ritonavir may also play a role in limiting cellular transport and efflux of other protease inhibitors via the P-glycoprotein and MRP efflux channels [A19647].</span>

However, ibuprofen is considered an NSAID and thus it is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase, which is an enzyme involved in prostaglandin (mediators of pain and fever) and thromboxane (stimulators of blood clotting) synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway.[L4614]\r\n\r\nIbuprofen is a non-selective COX inhibitor and hence, it inhibits the activity of both COX-1 and COX-2. The inhibition of COX-2 activity decreases the synthesis of prostaglandins involved in mediating inflammation, pain, fever, and swelling while the inhibition of COX-1 is thought to cause some of the side effects of ibuprofen including GI ulceration.[A39195]</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 6 Ibuprofen is rapidly metabolized and biotransformed in the liver to the formation of major metabolites which are the hydroxylated and carboxylated derivatives.[A39092] As soon as it is absorbed, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive enantiomeric conversion (53-65%) to the more active S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase.[A39194] \r\n\r\nIbuprofen metabolism can be divided in phase I which is represented by the hydroxylation of the isobutyl chains for the formation of 2 or 3-hydroxy derivatives followed by oxidation to 2-carboxy-ibuprofen and p-carboxy-2-propionate. These oxidative reactions are performed by the activity of the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP 2C9, CYP 2C19 and CYP 2C8. Therefore, these enzymes participate in the oxidation of the alkyl side chain to hydroxyl and carboxyl derivatives. From this enzymes, the major catalyst in the formation of oxidative metabolites is the isoform CYP 2C9.[A39190]\r\n\r\nThe metabolic phase I is followed by a phase II in which the oxidative metabolites may be conjugated to glucuronide prior to excretion. This activity forms phenolic and acyl glucuronides.[A39190]</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2 After oral administration, azithromycin is widely distributed in tissues with an apparent steady-state volume of distribution of 31.1 L/kg [FDA label].  Significantly greater azithromycin concentrations have been measured in the tissues rather than in plasma or serum  [FDA label], [A174172]. The lung, tonsils and prostate are organs have shown a particularly high rate of azithromycin uptake [A174172].\r\n\r\nThis drug is concentrated within macrophages and polymorphonucleocytes, allowing for effective activity against Chlamydia trachomatis [A174175]. In addition, azithromycin is found to be concentrated in phagocytes and fibroblasts, shown by in vitro incubation techniques. In vivo studies demonstrate that concentration in phagocytes may contribute to azithromycin distribution to inflamed tissues [FDA label].</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2 **Rat Oral LD50**: &gt;2000 mk/kg [MSDS]\r\n\r\nPossible major adverse effects include cardiovascular arrhythmias and hearing loss. Macrolide resistance is also an ongoing issue [A174172]. Hepatotoxicity has been since in rare cases [A174175]. \r\n\r\n**A note on the risk of liver toxicity**:\r\n\r\nDue to the act that  azithromycin is mainly eliminated by the liver, caution should be observed when azithromycin is given to patients with decreased hepatic function [FDA label]. \r\n\r\n**A note on potential renal toxicity**:\r\n\r\nBecause limited data in patients with renal GFR &lt;10 mL/min, caution should be exercised when prescribing azithromycin to these patients [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Use in Pregnancy**:\r\n\r\nThis drug is categorized as a pregnancy category B drug. Reproduction studies have been done in rats and mice at doses up to moderately maternally toxic doses (for example, 200 mg/kg/day). These doses, based on a mg/m2 basis, are approximately 4 and 2 times, respectively, the human daily dose of 500 mg. In the animal studies, no harmful effects to the fetus due to azithromycin were observed. There are, at this time, no conclusive and well-controlled studies that have been done in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies do not always predict human response, azithromycin should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Nursing Mothers**: \r\n\r\nIt is unknown at this time whether azithromycin is excreted in human milk. Because many other drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be observed when azithromycin is given to a nursing woman [FDA label].\r\n\r\n**Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility**: \r\n\r\nLong-term studies in animals have not been performed to study carcinogenic potential. Azithromycin has demonstrated no potential to be mutagenic in standard laboratory tests. No evidence of negative effects on fertility due to azithromycin was found [FDA label].</span>

One patient in clinical trials took ritonavir 1500 mg/day for two days. The patient reported paresthesias which resolved after the dose was decreased. A post-marketing case of renal failure with eosinophilia has been reported with ritonavir overdose. The approximate lethal dose was found to be greater than 20 times the related human dose in rats and 10 times the related human dose in mice. Oral LD value in rats is &gt;2500 mg/kg.
